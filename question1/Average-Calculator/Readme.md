# Average-Calculator

A Node.js application that fetches numbers from an external API and calculates the average of the most recent 10 numbers. It uses an in-memory sliding window to keep track of the latest numbers and responds with the current and previous window states along with the average.

## Features

* Fetch numbers from an external API.
* Maintain a sliding window of the last 10 unique numbers.
* Calculate the average of the numbers in the sliding window.
* Handle API timeouts or errors gracefully.
* Expose a REST API endpoint to interact with the application.

## Technologies Used

* **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
* **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client to make API requests.
* **In-memory Sliding Window**: Stores the latest unique numbers and calculates their average.
